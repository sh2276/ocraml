  OCRaml is an optical character recognition system that allows users to input 
  images of handwritten characters and detect which characters are written. 
  Behind the scenes, we will build a simple neural network (perceptron or 
  multi-layer perceptron, TBD) built from scratch. To use this program, we have 
  a GUI where you can upload a handwritten letter and predict what it is.
